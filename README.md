# Manny’s Painting Company — Contractor Quote & Review Platform

A production-grade contractor operations platform that allows customers to request service quotes, upload project photos, and submit post-job reviews — while providing contractors with a secure admin dashboard to manage leads and customer feedback.

The platform replaces manual contractor workflows (phone calls, emails, spreadsheets) with a **structured digital pipeline for lead intake, job tracking, and reputation management**.

Built using a **modern serverless architecture** with Netlify Functions, MongoDB Atlas, and Cloudinary.
